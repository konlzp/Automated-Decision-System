The following manual divides into 3 sections, each section is concerned about one of the 3 functions we were asked to define, which are accordingly decide(), sensitivity() and explain():

1. In decide() function, we take optionList as the input parameter and return the option in optionList that has the highest npv value. It also adds a field "npv" into the option object, so please do not access the npv field before calling the decide() function.

2. In sensitivity() function, we also take optionList as the input parameter and return the option in optionList that has the highest point in the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis alters the value of the given conditions of a certain option, if under this scenario, a certain option has the highest npv among its counterparts, then it wins certain amount of points. In my program, different weights were given to different conditions, for instance, points given to the cost of the factory is less than that given to the revenue per car. That's because the cost may not be likely to vary in the future than the revenue per car.

3. In the notorious explain() function, instead of making decision depending on the specific stakeholder, we stick to the one and only decision we made in the decide() function. Based on the analysis we did in decide() and sensitivity() functions, we generate different explanation towards different stakeholders. For instance, if we choose OH as our decision, we may explain to SC that OH provides higher NPV and that if certain conditions change, we will reconsider our decision and choose SC instead.
